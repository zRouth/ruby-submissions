Mousiki

Pitch

A website that automatically populates a concert tracker from your spotify's most listened to artists and lets you know when they are playing in your area

Problem

Most of today's solutions for finding concerts involve going to ticketmaster, or songkick, or the artists tour dates on their webpage and manually finding them.  We are all very busy people and sometimes we just don't have the time to go find concerts for a band we are interested in.  Somtimes we just forgot and the concert comes and tomorrows too late.

Solution

Mousiki automatically populates the the concert finder with your spotify music that you already listen to.  It will populate the concerts based on how soon the artist is coming to your city and then will also show you which music you listen to the most and put those in your favorites.  This way you don't have to keep track of any artists, as you listen to more and different music and artists the app will automatically update and show you when these artists are coming to play at a city near you

Target Audience

Everyone who listens to music and currently does, or does not attend concerts
